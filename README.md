The purpose of this application was to design an application where the user was presented with a daily schedule to help monitor and maintain their daily tasks. The user experience was enhanced with the dynamic rows updated by the previous and current hours color-coded. 

Additionally, the user is able to input data, close the application and revisit it at another time, without losing their data. This was accomplished via the local storage application.

Lastly, this application includes a aesthetic styling to compliment the user experience.
